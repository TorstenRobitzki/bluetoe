     @peripheral ble abstraction expected to have following functions
       start_flash( start_address, callback(error, mtu, receive_capacity, checksum) )
       send_data( data )
       register_progress_callback(callback(checksum, consecutive, mtu, receive_capacity))
       unregister_progress_callback(callback)
     @start_address address to flash the data on the target
     @data Buffer containing the data to be flashed
     @address_size size of an address on the target in bytes
     @page_size size of flash page on the target in bytes
     @page_buffer number of page buffers within the targets bootloader
     @cb callback to be called, when the flashing is done or when an error occured
