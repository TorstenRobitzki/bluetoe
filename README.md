## Overview

Bluetoe implements a GATT server with a very low memory footprint and a convenience C++ interface. Bluetoe makes easy things easy but gives the opportunity to fiddle with all the low level GATT details if necessary. The main target of Bluetoe is to be implemented on very small microcontrollers. Here is an example of a small GATT server:

    #include <bluetoe/server.hpp>
    #include <bluetoe/service.hpp>
    #include <bluetoe/characteristic.hpp>

    std::int32_t temperature;
    const char serivce_name[]        = "Temperature / Bathroom";
    const char characteristic_name[] = "Temperature in 10th degree celsius";

    typedef bluetoe::server<
        bluetoe::server_name< server_name >,
        bluetoe::service<
            bluetoe::service_uuid< 0x8C8B4094, 0x0000, 0x499F, 0xA28A, 0x4EED5BC73CA9 >,
            bluetoe::characteristic<
                bluetoe::characteristic_name< char_name >,
                bluetoe::characteristic_uuid< 0x8C8B4094, 0x0000, 0x499F, 0xA28A, 0x4EED5BC73CAA >,
                bluetoe::bind_characteristic_value< decltype( temperature ), &temperature >
            >
        >
    > temperature_service;

    int main()
    {
        temperature_service                                             server;
        bluetoe::binding::btstack_libusb_device< temperature_service >  device;

        device.run( server );
    }

## L2CAP

Bluetoe ships with its own link layer. Currently a link layer based on the nrf51422 is under construction and is already usable. The link layer implementation will be based and tested on an abstract device, called a scheduled radio and should be easily ported to similar hardware. As Bluetoe is a GATT server implementation, only that parts of the link layer are implemented, that are nessary. Bluetoe can easily adapted to any other existing L2CAP implementation (based on HCI for example).
